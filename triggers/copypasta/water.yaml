  content: I cant believe you trust KQM's info, didn't you know that KQM is a corrupt capitalist group with lobbying from Big Water™️ to push hydro units so more people buy Aquafina and Dasani. I mean its obvious, just look at their tierlist. XQ at S+, all the hydro 5 stars in S besides Mona, who they obviously have bias against because one of the biggest Mona supporters is LaCola, a rival genshin personality with backing from coca-cola and other soft drinks. I would never trust a KQM guide, just like how I would never touch a glass of water. Instead of doing honest theorycrafting by clearing the abyss with a 10/10/10 character they hid behind their "math" while they line their pockets like the hydration shills they are. I even heard they are expanding into the electronics industry with backing from tech companies, why else would they say units like fischl and raiden are good, they cant be, they're electro.
